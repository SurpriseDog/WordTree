Remember that some words have multiple meanings that will make it appear artificially high on the frequency table fpm rankings. fpm = Frequency per million Words

For example: The Spanish word 'para' is actually a conjugation of the spanish verb parir, but it's primary meaning will make it have a fpm well over 6000 while 'parir' is only at 1.5 fpm. If a conjugation has an abnomally high fpm compared to the rest of the table, it may be one of these words. Use this as a tool to help you find useful words, but double check any unusually high rankings.
